## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1b] - 2021-01-29

### Fixes
- Fixed missing Biome Locator mod.

## [2.0.1] - 2021-01-29

### Updates
- THIS UPDATE WILL LIKELY BREAK YOUR EXISTING WORLDS. IT'S RECOMMENDED YOU BACK UP YOUR WORLD, AND IN THE WORST-CASE, START A NEW ONE!
- Updated to 1.16.4 - means we can move update a bunch of mods that have fallen behind! There may be some unintended side effects, though.
- Over 50 new quests to help guide players with the new content!
- The addition of Traverse, Terrestria, Cinderscapes, BetterEnd, and BetterNether means much more fleshed out vanilla dimensions. Find new mobs in The Nether and The End!
- Incorporation of the End City datapack makes The End so much more interesting! Check it out!
- Go Fish adds a bunch of new fish that can be found in each dimension!
- New Scrolls and Pocket Wormholes from Waystones lets you teleport to discovered waystones!
- Ascendancies have been reworked slighly.
- New Transfer Chest acts as an Ender Chest but for ALL players! Easily send items interdimensionally to your friends or newbies with this new chest.
- New hammer type of weapon! From iron -> aeternium, these sluggish weapons have high base damage but virtually no critical chance. They also knock back enemies pretty far! Note: the lowest tier hammer is iron, and has a minimum level of 10.
- TONS of new content in The Nether and The End now! New gear that can be found and crafted! Check the quest book for more details!
- Partying now provides ADDITIONAL experience for each party member. 1 player = 100%, 2 players = 120%/2 = 60%, 3 players = 140%/3 = 46.67%, etc.
- Reduced gear drop rate by 40%.
- Gear progression has been slightly reworked. Some equips were way too difficult to find, and with the addition of new craftable equipment, some values have been shifted. More importantly, most equips cannot roll as any type now. For example, in the early game, leather will always roll as leather and iron will roll as plate. Another change: gold can only roll as cloth now. For the list of craftable gear and their types, refer to the Wiki. Do keep in mind, it's still way easier to just craft Age of Exile gear which is actually slightly _stronger_ than non-AoE gear!
- Reduced mob scaling by 20%.
- Mobs are a bit easier in dimensions after the Overworld now.
- Reduced the cooldown of the "ball" spells and thunder spear. Spells felt too clunky to use early on.
- Increased the damage of Lightning Totem by 12.5%.
- The new biome locator will help you locate specific biomes - it's basically Nature's Compass. There is also a quest showcasing this.
- Crafting cost of waystones has been lowered from tier 3 to crystallized essence.
- You must now hold a gold ingot in order to edit signs.
- Notes: with so many changes, I might have forgotten to record some...

### Updates
- Age of Exile is now compatible with Art of Alchemy! You can now turn (almost) ANYTHING into Age of Exile materials! Yes, that means you don't even need to fight to farm materials! Turn your crops, ores, blocks into cloth, leather, essences, etc.! Note: gems, runes, currencies, and equipment not included. Materials only!

### Fixes

## [1.3.4] - 2020-11-30

### Updates
- With the addition of Heartbond, /tpa has been removed. Heartbond is more thematically interesting than a command and functions similarly.
- To use Heartbond, craft 2 Ender Hearts and combine them with soul sand or soul soil. This will create an Ender Soul which links the two hearts together. Using this technique, a single Ender Heart can be linked to as many other Ender Hearts as you want, as many times as you want. Use the Ender Soul by right clicking it while both players are wearing the appropriate Ender Hearts (Curios slot).
- /home has once again been disabled. The only command remaining is /rtp. I wanted to remove /home for a while since it made the teleportation scrolls obsolete, and also caused crashes. I will continue looking for a Waystone alternative. /rtp continues to be server-only!
- Spawn and death teleport scrolls are now much cheaper to craft.
- Nerfed EXP gain from Endermen and Silverfish.
- Increased minimum level of the Wither, Blackstone Golem, and Ender Dragon to be 10 levels above the minimum level of the dimension instead of the same level.
- Increased max claim size by 100%.
- Cursed Spawners now have a chance to drop ward blocks.
- Added more particles to effects for better visualization.
- Reduced difficulty of common and magic mobs, reduced overall EXP from mobs.
- Mob scaling has increased since early level mobs have been made easier also. Level 50 mobs will be 50% stronger than they currently are.

### Mod Updates
- Updated ItemFlexer, FLAN, Xaero's, Fabric Waystones.
- Added Your Options Shall Be Respected.
- Added Heartbond.
- Added Hypnos.
- Removed Gunpowder SleepVote.
- Removed Random Configs - YOSBR replaces this mod.
- Removed Sodium - it's a great Fabric mod but is causing some texture issues with some mods. It is still suggested you use it, but I will leave it up to user discretion.

### Fixes
- Fixed Assassin ascendancy not being available.
- Disabled Charm barrel variants.
- LibGui is no longer set to dark mode by default.
- I think attack speed should work now.

## [1.3.3] - 2020-11-25

- A quest entry for Art of Alchemy has been added.

## [1.3.2b] - 2020-11-24

### Fixes
- Fixed Blood Mage for real this time!

## [1.3.2] - 2020-11-23

### Updates
Item Balance:
- Added 57 new uniques consisting of weapons, jewelry, and shields.
- Uniques, runewords, and regular affix items (mythic, rare, etc.) have had their stats completely refactored. In short, uniques and runewords received a substantial nerf to damage (defense remains more or less untouched), and affixes have been buffed slightly overall. Before, runewords were powerful and deterministic. I want them to still retain their power but to fall more in line with the scaling of Age of Exile. Some runewords and uniques will be meant for leveling, some will be all-around good, and some will be build enablers. Another one of my goals was to encourage crafting, and in order to do so I had to bring affix items 'up to standards' while bringing the other two down. This is a continuing work in progress - I don't think I'll get it right this time round but hopefully it's one step closer.
- Weapons now have a flat critical hit base. For instance, the axe's critical hit base has changed from 4-10% to always 5% (10% at level 50).
- Weapons have had their base critical hit lowered overall. Axes and bows are still kings of critical hit chance, while wands and scepters have very low critical hit chance.
- Sword damage has gone up slightly.
- Spears have been buffed significantly. They have high base damage and armor penetration but low critical hit chance.
- Added new affixes for weapons.
- Added new affix for jewelry and wands.
- Heal to spell power stat has been reduced in power. Uniques with this stat still have high values of this stat, but don't offer as much healing power anymore. This is to encourage mixing other items instead of stacking all these uniques that do the same thing.
- Runes have had their values shifted slightly.
- Call to Arms runeword has been reworked.
- Rhyme runeword now grants immunity to slow.

Skill Tree:
- Skill trees have been reworked and now include more augments.
- New ice spell: Frost Shield - gives caster and nearby allies magic shield. Can be upgraded with improved auras in the Divine tree.
- New thunder spell: Thunder Orb - an orb that does area of effect damage as it moves and explodes upon exiration.
- New thunder spell: Thunder Strikes - a melee thunder spell that hits rapidly.
- New physical spell: Warrior's Rage - a passive for physical tree that causes you to go into a rage. Heals you and then reduces your armor while increasing damage.
- New physical spell: and Taunt - reduces nearby enemy defense while increasing their attack.
- Elemental "ultimate" spells such as Thunder Storm, Blizzard, and Volcano have had their duration and damage greatly increased.
- Ground Slam has been reworked to be more utility-based. Cleave has been greatly improved in terms of damage.
- Auras now last 6 minutes instead of 30 seconds, and have an "upgraded" version that can be obtained at the end of the Divine tree.
- Increased cooldown of all "basic spells" by 20 ticks.
- Imbue now scales with weapon damage when using arrow spells (before it just added flat elemental damage).
- Physical spells have been generally improved/buffed.
- Poison Ball base damage has increased by 20%.
- Frostball chill augment now applies chill instead of dealing extra damage if the opponent has it.
- Poisoned weapons has been buffed - it actually applies poison now.
- Increased attack scaling of bow skills.
- Burn damage has increased by 100%.
- Wounds reduces healing by 50% instead of 25%.
- Judgement damage has increased by 100%.
- Static can now stack up to 10 times, up from 1, but reduces thunder resist by 3% per stack instead of 20%.
- Thorns now scales a bit off of weapon damage and can stack up to 3 times, up from 1.
- Chill can now stack up to 8 times, up from 1, and reduces enemy movement speed by 8% per stack instead of 5%. It reduces water resistance by 2% per stack instead of 15%.

Talent Tree:
- Reworked some of the major perks in the bottom half of the tree - there are more to choose from. Blood Mage has also been reworked (and actually works now).
- Keystones have been buffed.

Other:
- Mobs now scale to level 50 instead of 45.
- Increased XP gain from spawners back to 50% from 33%.
- Reduced favor gain from chests to 25 from 50.
- Drop rate of equipment has increased by about 13%.
- Drop rate of runes has decreased by 20%.
- Drop rate of uniques has decreased but increases as you go through the dimensions. From lowest drop rate of uniques to highest: Overworld (0.65), The Nether (0.7), The End (0.75), The Bumblezone (0.8). Values are relative to what it used to be.
- Increased HP of Ender Dragon, Wither, and Blackstone Golem.
- Deadeye can no longer climb but claustrophobia is 90% less effective.
- Assassins have gone back to the old stealth instead of invisibility and now deal extra damage.

### Mod Updates

## [1.3.1] - 2020-11-11

### Updates
- You now only do 20% of your damage when in PvP. This is common practice with RPG games, otherwise it becomes a "who can hit the other guy first" battle.

- Antiques can now have 1-5 sockets instead of 1-3.
- Reduced the drop rate of relics to compensate for change above.
- Major buff to uniques across the board.

- Increased base armor, dodge, and magic shield values from Age of Exile gear.
- Crossbows now have armor penetration at the cost of reduced critical hit chance.
- Bow max base damage roll was increased by about 15%.
- Bows have had their critical hit chance reduced heavily.
- Critical hit chance and damage has been reduced.
- Lowered the base value of almost all elemental spells by about 15-25%.
- Reduced power of spell damage affixes slightly.
- Mobs now scale at a higher rate. That is to say, level 50 mobs will be twice as strong as they currently are.
- Increased EXP curve. As a result, I've bumped up EXP gain by about 33%. Overall, it should still be slower.
- Skeleton vanguards and summoners have been weakened greatly.
- Skeleton vanguards, summoners, endermites, slimes, drowned, and iron golems have all had their EXP reduced.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-28

### Updates
- New singular skill tree which replaces the existing multiple skill trees. Pick your starting position on the tree. You can now access every element/archetype from any starting position, but it may require some trekking across the skill tree. Currently, each stat is specific to an archetype (melee, spells, ranged). Within each archetype you may have access to different elements. Melee focuses on physical (primary), fire, and nature; spells focuses on arcane + water (primary), thunder, and fire; ranged focuses on physical (primary), nature, and thunder. Divine spells have been spread across the tree. Accessing different "elements" of the tree is possible but gated behind the 15th level.
- Increased area of effect of all skills by 50%, aura skills by 100%.
- Increased projectile speed of all spells by 100%.
- Added new physical damage skills: double strike, cleave, ground slam, flicker strike.

- Enigma now grants 'Teleport'.
- Enabled vein mining by default (no need to hold key down). You just need to use the right tool.
