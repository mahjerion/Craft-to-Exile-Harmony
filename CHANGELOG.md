### Updates
- 3 new bosses have been added through Bosses of Mass Destruction, each with their own very unique mechanics! Find the Night Lich in cold biomes in the Overworld, the Nether Gauntlet in the Nether, and Obsidilith on End islands! These new powerful bosses provide even more loot than other bosses and have new and interesting mechanics!
- Added new quests for the new bosses.
- Added a new weekly quest for the new bosses. Kill the bosses every week for unique crates!
- Enhanced Celestials is replacing Crimson Moon which had a slew of bugs. Enhanced Celestials has more to offer such as Blood Moons, Harvest Moons, AND Blue Moons!!! Blood Moons increase mob spawns and prevent sleeping, Harvest Moons increase crop growth rate and crop drop rate, and Blue Moons applies the luck effect to all NON monster entities (chests!).
- A few new structures have been added by Mo' Structures!
- New dungeons from YUNG's Better Dungeons have been added!
- Opening chests reduces the XP penalty in the same chunk. Before, killing many mobs in a tower would reduce the XP gained even though players were "honestly" climbing the tower. This should alleviate those issues.
- Mob spawners now have a shorter cooldown of 15 minutes after triggering, down from 60 minutes.
- Sodium compatibility has been improved.
- Players now receive an Orb of Ascendancy from the first quest. The first quest also briefly explains what it does and how to get them.

- Undo Age of Exile update.

### Fixes

## [2.1.2] - 2021-04-12

### Updates
- Sorry it's been a while since the last update. This update will act as a stepping stone until the new Age of Exile update is out (which adds a lot of content!). Stay tuned.
- I've updated the default GUI. The mini-map is now on the right and we're now using the RPG gui rather than the vanilla GUI. I mainly did this because you get more information out of the RPG HUD (level, EXP bar, area level) which you wouldn't get with the vanilla-style HUD. I've also added Inventory HUD+ which provides some more info. All of these changes are configurable in the mod menu, so feel free to change it back if you don't like it.
- Reduced the maximum damage of Hammers by about 15%.
- Reduced strength of Ork mobs.
- Creepers now spawn more regularly.
- A new AdventureZ mob is introduced: the Dragon.
- Dark Dungeon wave that provides unique loot crates now provides rare loot crates instead.

- Added Inventory HUD+.
- Added Cardinal Components API.

### Fixes
- Fixed Hypnos messages appearing funky.
- Replaced mages, slimes, summoners, and creepers in Dark Dungeon wave spawners. This should drastically reduce the chance of "broken" spawners.
- Small fix for Age of Exile item repair stuff. Only affects newly created items and not already existing items.

## [2.1.1c] - 2021-03-02

## [2.1.1] - 2021-02-27

### Updates
- End gear progression has been slightly reworked with the introduction of Thallasium. Thallasium is now what Aeternium was (level 35-45), and Aeternium level has been increased to 40-50. As a result, I've improved the base stats of Crystalite to be more in line with what AoE gear was before.
- In addition to the above change, spell damage has been removed off crafted non-AoE cloth helmets (this should never have been there, this is more of a bug fix). To encourage crafting AoE gear when possible, all AoE gear have received new implicit stats! For example, AoE cloth gear will improve mana regen/spell damage, etc., and leather gear will improve critical hit and damage, etc.
- Poison Ball, Frost Ball, Fireball, and Thunder Spear have had their damaged buffed, and cooldowns reduced by 0.5s.
- Lightning Totem now lasts longer (from 6 to 9 seconds), does 10% more damage, and costs ~15% less mana.
- MobZ introduces over 20 new high-quality mobs!
- Updated Crystal of Truth tooltip to better reflect what it does.
- New Crimson Moon weapon has been added.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Traverse, Monster of the Ocean Depths, Cloth Config API, FlytreLib, Mod Menu, Crimson Moon, REI, Where Is It, Repurposed Structures, Architectury, Fabric API, Lib Block Attributes, Lithium, Origins, Polymorph.
- Added MobZ.

### Fixes
- Crash caused by Lurkers should be fixed.

## [2.0.1b] - 2021-01-29

## [2.0.1] - 2021-01-29

### Updates
- THIS UPDATE WILL LIKELY BREAK YOUR EXISTING WORLDS. IT'S RECOMMENDED YOU BACK UP YOUR WORLD, AND IN THE WORST-CASE, START A NEW ONE!
- Updated to 1.16.4 - means we can move update a bunch of mods that have fallen behind! There may be some unintended side effects, though.
- Over 50 new quests to help guide players with the new content!
- The addition of Traverse, Terrestria, Cinderscapes, BetterEnd, and BetterNether means much more fleshed out vanilla dimensions. Find new mobs in The Nether and The End!
- Incorporation of the End City datapack makes The End so much more interesting! Check it out!
- Go Fish adds a bunch of new fish that can be found in each dimension!
- New Scrolls and Pocket Wormholes from Waystones lets you teleport to discovered waystones!
- Ascendancies have been reworked slighly.
- New Transfer Chest acts as an Ender Chest but for ALL players! Easily send items interdimensionally to your friends or newbies with this new chest.
- New hammer type of weapon! From iron -> aeternium, these sluggish weapons have high base damage but virtually no critical chance. They also knock back enemies pretty far! Note: the lowest tier hammer is iron, and has a minimum level of 10.
- TONS of new content in The Nether and The End now! New gear that can be found and crafted! Check the quest book for more details!
- Partying now provides ADDITIONAL experience for each party member. 1 player = 100%, 2 players = 120%/2 = 60%, 3 players = 140%/3 = 46.67%, etc.
- Reduced gear drop rate by 40%.
- Gear progression has been slightly reworked. Some equips were way too difficult to find, and with the addition of new craftable equipment, some values have been shifted. More importantly, most equips cannot roll as any type now. For example, in the early game, leather will always roll as leather and iron will roll as plate. Another change: gold can only roll as cloth now. For the list of craftable gear and their types, refer to the Wiki. Do keep in mind, it's still way easier to just craft Age of Exile gear which is actually slightly _stronger_ than non-AoE gear!
- Reduced mob scaling by 20%.
- Mobs are a bit easier in dimensions after the Overworld now.
- Reduced the cooldown of the "ball" spells and thunder spear. Spells felt too clunky to use early on.
- Increased the damage of Lightning Totem by 12.5%.
- The new biome locator will help you locate specific biomes - it's basically Nature's Compass. There is also a quest showcasing this.
- Crafting cost of waystones has been lowered from tier 3 to crystallized essence.
- You must now hold a gold ingot in order to edit signs.
- Notes: with so many changes, I might have forgotten to record some...

## [1.3.4] - 2020-11-30

### Updates
- With the addition of Heartbond, /tpa has been removed. Heartbond is more thematically interesting than a command and functions similarly.
- To use Heartbond, craft 2 Ender Hearts and combine them with soul sand or soul soil. This will create an Ender Soul which links the two hearts together. Using this technique, a single Ender Heart can be linked to as many other Ender Hearts as you want, as many times as you want. Use the Ender Soul by right clicking it while both players are wearing the appropriate Ender Hearts (Curios slot).
- /home has once again been disabled. The only command remaining is /rtp. I wanted to remove /home for a while since it made the teleportation scrolls obsolete, and also caused crashes. I will continue looking for a Waystone alternative. /rtp continues to be server-only!

## [1.3.2b] - 2020-11-24

### Fixes
- Fixed Blood Mage for real this time!

## [1.3.2] - 2020-11-23

### Updates
Item Balance:
- Added 57 new uniques consisting of weapons, jewelry, and shields.
- Uniques, runewords, and regular affix items (mythic, rare, etc.) have had their stats completely refactored. In short, uniques and runewords received a substantial nerf to damage (defense remains more or less untouched), and affixes have been buffed slightly overall. Before, runewords were powerful and deterministic. I want them to still retain their power but to fall more in line with the scaling of Age of Exile. Some runewords and uniques will be meant for leveling, some will be all-around good, and some will be build enablers. Another one of my goals was to encourage crafting, and in order to do so I had to bring affix items 'up to standards' while bringing the other two down. This is a continuing work in progress - I don't think I'll get it right this time round but hopefully it's one step closer.
- Weapons now have a flat critical hit base. For instance, the axe's critical hit base has changed from 4-10% to always 5% (10% at level 50).
- Weapons have had their base critical hit lowered overall. Axes and bows are still kings of critical hit chance, while wands and scepters have very low critical hit chance.
- Sword damage has gone up slightly.
- Spears have been buffed significantly. They have high base damage and armor penetration but low critical hit chance.
- Added new affixes for weapons.
- Added new affix for jewelry and wands.
- Heal to spell power stat has been reduced in power. Uniques with this stat still have high values of this stat, but don't offer as much healing power anymore. This is to encourage mixing other items instead of stacking all these uniques that do the same thing.
- Runes have had their values shifted slightly.
- Call to Arms runeword has been reworked.
- Rhyme runeword now grants immunity to slow.

Skill Tree:
- Skill trees have been reworked and now include more augments.
- New ice spell: Frost Shield - gives caster and nearby allies magic shield. Can be upgraded with improved auras in the Divine tree.
- New thunder spell: Thunder Orb - an orb that does area of effect damage as it moves and explodes upon exiration.
- New thunder spell: Thunder Strikes - a melee thunder spell that hits rapidly.
- New physical spell: Warrior's Rage - a passive for physical tree that causes you to go into a rage. Heals you and then reduces your armor while increasing damage.
- New physical spell: and Taunt - reduces nearby enemy defense while increasing their attack.
- Elemental "ultimate" spells such as Thunder Storm, Blizzard, and Volcano have had their duration and damage greatly increased.
- Ground Slam has been reworked to be more utility-based. Cleave has been greatly improved in terms of damage.
- Auras now last 6 minutes instead of 30 seconds, and have an "upgraded" version that can be obtained at the end of the Divine tree.
- Increased cooldown of all "basic spells" by 20 ticks.
- Imbue now scales with weapon damage when using arrow spells (before it just added flat elemental damage).
- Physical spells have been generally improved/buffed.
- Poison Ball base damage has increased by 20%.
- Frostball chill augment now applies chill instead of dealing extra damage if the opponent has it.
- Poisoned weapons has been buffed - it actually applies poison now.
- Increased attack scaling of bow skills.
- Burn damage has increased by 100%.
- Wounds reduces healing by 50% instead of 25%.
- Judgement damage has increased by 100%.
- Static can now stack up to 10 times, up from 1, but reduces thunder resist by 3% per stack instead of 20%.
- Thorns now scales a bit off of weapon damage and can stack up to 3 times, up from 1.
- Chill can now stack up to 8 times, up from 1, and reduces enemy movement speed by 8% per stack instead of 5%. It reduces water resistance by 2% per stack instead of 15%.

Talent Tree:
- Reworked some of the major perks in the bottom half of the tree - there are more to choose from. Blood Mage has also been reworked (and actually works now).
- Keystones have been buffed.

Other:
- Mobs now scale to level 50 instead of 45.
- Increased XP gain from spawners back to 50% from 33%.
- Reduced favor gain from chests to 25 from 50.
- Drop rate of equipment has increased by about 13%.
- Drop rate of runes has decreased by 20%.
- Drop rate of uniques has decreased but increases as you go through the dimensions. From lowest drop rate of uniques to highest: Overworld (0.65), The Nether (0.7), The End (0.75), The Bumblezone (0.8). Values are relative to what it used to be.
- Increased HP of Ender Dragon, Wither, and Blackstone Golem.
- Deadeye can no longer climb but claustrophobia is 90% less effective.
- Assassins have gone back to the old stealth instead of invisibility and now deal extra damage.

- Skeleton vanguards, summoners, endermites, slimes, drowned, and iron golems have all had their EXP reduced.
