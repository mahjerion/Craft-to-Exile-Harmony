If you want to edit the skill trees or create new ones, you will need a .csv editor to open the .ods files!

They are custom formatted to allow you to easily create the trees.

I suggest trio office. It's a free program. 

When you edit it. Click save. Then click save as and then save as .csv file. 

(YES DO BOTH. you want to keep your .ODS file updated OR ELSE YOU WILL WASTE TIME!)

Open that .csv with notepad++, copy the whole thing and paste it to the appropriate skill tree .json in the "perks" field.


Also: these skill trees use datapacks called perks. I already create a bunch for the mod but you can create more or edit them too!

I also added optional locking of perks under vanilla advancements/achievements. That might be helpful with modpacks.

You could have a powerful class gated behind some advancements, or gate just parts of skill trees. Possibilities!

Also, there are multiple types of perks: SPELL, STAT, START and SPECIAL.

spell, stat are self explanatory

Start is for the starting point of the skill tree.

Special is a way of differentiating good perks, it uses a prettier icon.

There'a also a required field, [CENTER]. This tells the game where to center the gui to.

Always a good idea to start by copying an existing skill tree and modifying it.
